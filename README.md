**St**ere**o**ptic **a**nalysis of the **t**ranscriptome using PRO-seq and TED-seq

## Abstract <img src="stoat.png" alt="drawing" width="100" align="left"/>
A stereoptic analysis that adds dynamics-perception using binocular perspectives of the static transcriptome; transcription rate and polyadenylation status. Transcription rate, measured by nascent RNA sequencing (PRO-seq), reflects the RNA synthesis level. Poly(A) tail length (PAL), measured by TED-seq, reflects the quality of the RNA, and is associated with translation and decay status. The starts and the ends of transcripts can be mapped using PRO-seq and TED-seq to re-define high-confidence annotation including novel transcripts. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional expression analysis identifies dynamically regulated transcripts.
